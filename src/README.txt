IMPLEMENTATION: APPLICATION

Display:
Player 1 starts at the top of the board, uses
the upside-down pieces, and can use the top droplist.

Player 2 starts at the bottom of the board, uses
the upright pieces, and can use the bottom droplist.



Movement:
Users can move pieces under their control during their turn.
To do so they can DRAG pieces to either an empty space
or a space inhabited by an enemy piece.

MOVEMENT RULES FOR EACH SPECIFIC PIECE AND BE FOUND:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi

Moving the mouse over a piece highlights where the piece
can legally move to.



Promotion:
Promotion occurs automatically.
After a piece is moved it will alternatively 
promote or demote.
Promotions/Demotions change the type of the piece and
consequently change it's rules on movement.

Tokin(T)(aka Promoted Pawn) becomes Lance(L) and vice-versa.
Silver General(S) becomes Bishop(B) and vice-versa.
Gold General(G) becomes Knight(N) and vice-versa.
Pawn(P) becomes Rook(R) and vice-versa.
King DOESN'T promote/demote.



Drop:
Captured Pieces can be reused by the player that caught it.
They can be dropped anywhere on board and will take up 
a turn.
Players can choose to drop pieces in a promoted or demoted
state. To do so, they can DOUBLE-CLICK the image on their
respective droplist.  Once they have the desired state,
they can DRAG the piece from the drop list to an empty 
place on the board.



Game Over:
The game ends when either king is captured.
Players will then have the option to play again or 
close the application.
